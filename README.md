# Satellite-MoI-Calculation

## Objective
The objective of this project is to calculate the satellite's Moment of Inertia based on historical orbital data. The final purpose was to return ideal reaction wheel spinning rates for attitude control and output the ideal satellite moment of inertia, replacing the original spinning rates.
